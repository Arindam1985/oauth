h2. Facebook OAuth 2 Sample Code

The sample code contained in this project is intended to be used to capture private Facebook data via OAuth 2.  This project contains several files that are required for integration:
* common.php - Common variables and functions
* index.php - Initiates the OAuth 2 request to Facebook
* complete.php - Exchanges code for access token then makes request to get user friends

To use this sample:
* Create a new Facebook application at http://www.facebook.com/developers/ to get a key and secret for the OAuth 2 process
* Copy all files to a directory of your choosing (in the same place as what was specified when creating your new Facebook application)
* Edit common.php and add in your key, secret and absolute path to your complete.php file
* Load index.php to begin the sample test
